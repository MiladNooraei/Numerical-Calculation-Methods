# Numerical Calculation Methods

In this project, some numerical calculations are implemented
## Description
Implemented following numerical calculation methods : 
- Gauss Jordan Elimination
solved example : 
```bash
0.3𝑥 + 9𝑦 − 𝑧 + 3𝑤 − 2𝑚 = 17
7𝑥 + 𝑧 − 4𝑤 − 𝑚 = 3
6𝑥 + 2𝑧 + 2 𝑦 + 𝑚 + 8𝑤 = 1
−1.2𝑧 + 17𝑦 + 𝑤 − 𝑥 = 15
𝑦 + 2𝑤 + 𝑧 − 𝑥 = −7
```
- Bisection Method
solved example : 
```bash
f(x) = x^3 + 4*x^2 - 2
where 0 < x < 1
and |f(x)| <= 0.004
```
- Newton Raphson Method
solved example : 
```bash
f(x) = x^3 - cube root(x^4 + x^2 + 5)
where 0 < x < 3
and n = 15
```
- Regula Falsi Method
solved example : 
```bash
f(x) = (x^3) - (2^((x)^(1/2)))
where 1 < x < 2
and remainder < 0.001
```
- Finding roots ranges using Bisection and Location
solved example : 
```bash
f(x) = 𝑆𝑖𝑛(31𝑥) − 2𝑐𝑜𝑠(23𝑥) = 0
where -7 <= x <= 6.5
and remainder < 0.001
```
- Power Method | Inverse Power Method
solved example : 
```bash
matrix = [[9, -3, -6],
          [2, 8, 2],
          [-5, 10, 7]]
```
- Simpson Rule
solved example : 
```bash
Input is in provide text file named "Simpson_Rule_input"
```
- Central Difference Method
solved example : 
```bash
Input is in provide text file named "Simpson_Rule_input" except first and last data
```
- Second Derivative Central Difference Method
solved example : 
```bash
Input is in provide text file named "Simpson_Rule_input" for datas number 5 upto 9991
```


Some methods has output plot as well.
